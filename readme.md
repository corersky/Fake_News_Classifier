#### Decription
The amount of misinformation spread on the social media platform and by the media houses has increased a lot in the recent past. 
Our society is in a grave danger because of the amount of misinformation spread since it can create mass hysteria, hatred and communal violence or polarization of votes during election based on incorrect data. 

However, in order to start addressing this problem, we need to have an understanding on what Fake News is. Only then can we look into the different techniques and fields of machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) that could help us fight this situation.

So, what exactly is fake news?
Fake news can be of different types such as 
1.	Satire or Parody which has no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool
2.	False connections when headlines, visuals or captions don’t support the content
3.	False context when genuine content is shared with false contextual information
4.	Etc 


Different problems require different solutions; 
Here we are targeting on the fake news related with False connections with headlines and the one with false contextual information. 

A similar dataset on Kaggle which has two news headlines and the first headline has been confirmed as the fake news. The problem states that given the title 1 as fake news, classify title 2 as unrelated, agreed or disagreed. 
This won’t solve the entire problem but it gave us a head start to us for approaching this problem.
